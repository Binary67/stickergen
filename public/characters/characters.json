      "description": "Dudu and Bubu - Dudu and Bubu are an adorable pair of cartoon bears drawn in a minimalist kawaii style. Dudu is a small, chubby brown bear with caramel-tan fur, tiny round ears matching his body color, simple dot eyes, and a distinctive yellow circular patch on one cheek with pink blush on the other. Bubu is a slightly larger, rounder white panda-like bear with pure white fur, contrasting dark brown/black round ears, dot eyes, and soft pink blush marks on both cheeks. Both characters have compact, rounded bodies with stubby limbs, no noses, and gentle expressions. They're always depicted together as an affectionate couple—holding hands, hugging, or enjoying activities side by side.",

      "description": "Quby is an ultra-minimalist, white blob-like character with a large round head that forms most of its body, simple black dot eyes, a small curved smile (sometimes showing two tiny front teeth when grinning), and distinctive horizontal pink rectangular blush marks on both cheeks. The character has a tiny body with short stubby arms and legs, giving it a mochi or dumpling-like appearance. Drawn in a clean, simple line art style with minimal details, Quby has an innocent, cheerful personality and is often depicted doing everyday activities like eating bananas, waving hello, or lounging with a laptop.",
